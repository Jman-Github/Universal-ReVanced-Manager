# 💊 Universal Patch Manager

Universal Patch Manager (UPM) is an Android manager for patching apps with ReVanced, Morphe, and Reseam in one place. Built from ReVanced Manager, UPM expands the full patching workflow with third-party patch bundles, multiple patcher runtimes, saved apps and patch profiles, batch and automatic repatching, flexible APK sources, advanced installers, and standalone APK utilities.

UPM supports the ReVanced, Morphe, and Reseam patch ecosystems, rooted and non-rooted workflows, local and remote patch bundle sources, split APK handling, downloader integrations, signature and keystore tools, detailed patching diagnostics, backups, storage controls, and extensive UI customization.

## 💪 Features

UPM covers the full patching lifecycle, from choosing an APK source and patch bundle to patching, installing, saving, repatching, automating updates, and managing the files and tools around those workflows.

For runtime behavior, memory limits, and troubleshooting, see the [patching runtime guide](upm-patcher-core/README.md).

  <li><strong>Signature metadata workflow:</strong> Optionally clone signature metadata from the original signed input into the final patched APK and remember that choice for saved apps, profiles, batch jobs, and automatic repatching.</li>
  <li><strong>Signing control:</strong> Use the manager keystore, import compatible keystores, or skip patched APK signing where supported.</li>
  <li><strong>Detailed patcher diagnostics:</strong> View elapsed time, app/runtime/device information, selected patches, split/native-library state, and expandable patcher steps and sub-steps.</li>

  <li><strong>APK download helper apps:</strong> Use supported standalone helper apps as APK sources, with helper discovery, signer trust, GitHub source management, and install/update controls.</li>
  <li><strong>Download cache management:</strong> Keep multiple downloaded APKs, export or delete individual entries, and optionally retain only the newest download for each app.</li>
  <li><strong>Saved patched apps:</strong> Keep patched APKs in the Apps tab for later install/export/repatch workflows and inspect the patches, bundles, and related metadata used to create them.</li>

## 🔽 Download

You can download the most recent version of Universal Patch Manager from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Jman-Github/universal-patch-manager/releases).

UP Manager uses the package <code>app.universal.patch.manager</code> and installs separately from the former URV app. Before switching, export your data from the old app using **Settings > Export & Import > Export everything**, then import that backup into UP Manager. Export and import your signing keystore separately on the same settings page so your patched apps keep the same signing key. Keep the old app installed until you have verified the imported data and key.

Existing URV JSON exports can be imported directly without renaming the files: **Import everything**, manager settings, patch bundles, patch profiles, and patch selections all retain their existing formats. UPM migrates the former manager API setting and manager-hosted plugin source URLs, and recognizes the old runtime package identities in imported settings. User-entered names, package names, options, and signing credentials are preserved.

Export/import the signing keystore separately; JSON backups do not include its key material. Files stored privately by URV and Android file-access grants do not move with a JSON backup. Reselect custom backgrounds, local bundle files, APK inputs, or option files if Android no longer grants access to them.

The embedded JVM uses OpenJDK 25 with compact object headers in 64-bit processes and OpenJDK 17 on 32-bit ARM. This configuration follows [Morphe Manager PR #1302](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-manager/pull/1302). Reseam continues to run in its isolated ART worker.

Runtime plugins must be built for UPM: <code>app.universal.patch.manager.revanced.v21.runtime</code> and <code>app.universal.patch.manager.revanced.v22.runtime</code>. The bundled Reseam runtime uses <code>app.universal.patch.manager.reseam.runtime</code>, and Morphe uses <code>app.universal.patch.manager.morphe.runtime</code>.


## 📋 Patch Bundles

UPM starts with no patch bundles installed. Add bundles through discovery or import.

UPM can add compatible ReVanced (<code>.rvp</code>), Morphe (<code>.mpp</code>), and Reseam (<code>.reseam</code>) patch bundles from local files, supported remote URLs, repository/release sources, and the in-app discovery catalog. ReVanced v21 and v22 bundles require their respective runtime plugins. Morphe and Reseam are included by default.

The [Patch Bundle Registry](https://github.com/Jman-Github/Patch-Bundle-Registry) maintains a searchable catalog of community patch sources. Visit its [patch browsing site](https://patch-bundles.jmancentral.com/) to explore bundles, patch lists, supported apps, release versions, and changelogs, and copy remote bundle URLs for import into UPM.

The same registry powers UPM's in-app patch bundle discovery, where you can search the catalog, inspect compatible apps and patches, and import supported bundles directly.

## 🔌 Supported Downloader Plugins

UPM supports compatible downloader plugins and standalone APK download helper apps as reusable APK sources. They can be installed or imported from supported GitHub repository, release, or APK asset URLs, managed from Downloader settings, and used directly in patching and tool workflows.

The [ReVanced Manager Downloaders](https://github.com/brosssh/revanced-manager-downloaders/releases) repository provides compatible downloader plugins for sources such as APKMirror, APKPure, and APKCombo. UPM also supports standalone APK download helper apps, such as [Helper For Morphe](https://github.com/rushiranpise/helper-for-morphe/releases).
