# 🧩 Managing downloaders

Learn how to manage downloaders.
Refer to the [template](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-manager-downloader-template) if you are developer who wants to create a plugin.

Downloaders are Apk files and are installed, updated and uninstalled just like regular Android apps.
Downloaders can execute arbitrary code inside ReVanced Manager and must be marked as trusted before use. Manager will show a notification in the dashboard when a new downloader is discovered.
Trust can also be granted and revoked under `Settings` > `Downloads`.
